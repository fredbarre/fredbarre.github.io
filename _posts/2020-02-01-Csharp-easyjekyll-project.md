My experience:

I Started this project in order to feel differences between c# and java .
I already feel pretty good with java writen an android app and desktop applications.
I had a pretty good experience with c# too.

I had some difficutly with winforms to create a grapÄ¥ical ui.

The goal:
The goal was to make editing for creating jekyll post much easier, in a local manner.
So you would type your post title , images , tags then your post; You would get a 
markdown .md file properly titled, options properly set up, ready to get drag and drop to your github folder.


The results so far:

I managed to make it happen create a markdown file to drag and drop.
The interface is a basic console application.
I tried to use winforms to make a quick interface I had a lots of problems with it.


I could've done better:
Finish graphical interface and connect the back end.
Push the change directly to the github account with github api.
Make the back-end more flexible to adapt more easily to others themes.


Here is a few screenshots for winforms graphical ui.
